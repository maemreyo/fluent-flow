# Bug Report: Practice Session Creation Fails Due to Null `video_id`

**Date:** 2025-08-26

## 1. Summary

When a user navigates to a new YouTube video, the application attempts to create a new `practice_sessions` record in the Supabase database. This operation is failing with a `400 Bad Request` because the `video_id` column, which has a `NOT NULL` constraint, is being sent as `null`.

## 2. Error Log

The following error is observed in `logs/check.log`:

```
POST https://fxawystovhtbuqhllswl.supabase.co/rest/v1/practice_sessions?select=id 400 (Bad Request)

fluent-flow-supabase-store.ts:261 Error creating session: {code: '23502', details: null, hint: null, message: 'null value in column "video_id" of relation "practice_sessions" violates not-null constraint'}
createSession @ fluent-flow-supabase-store.ts:261
...
initializePlayer @ fluent-flow-supabase-store.ts:1012
...
updateVideoInformation @ sidepanel.tsx:185
```

## 3. Root Cause Analysis

The error originates from a database constraint violation, but the root cause lies within the application's data flow logic.

1.  **Initiation:** The process starts in `sidepanel.tsx` when the active tab changes (`handleTabActivated`). The `updateVideoInformation` function is called.
2.  **Data Availability:** At this stage (`sidepanel.tsx:186`), the log confirms that the correct video information, including the video ID (`{id: 'tXYcLKC6g6Y', ...}`), is available.
3.  **Function Call Chain:** `updateVideoInformation` calls the `initializePlayer` function located in the `fluent-flow-supabase-store.ts` store.
4.  **Data Loss:** `initializePlayer` then calls the `createSession` function (also in `fluent-flow-supabase-store.ts`) to perform the database insertion. The error message (`null value in column "video_id"`) strongly indicates that the `video_id` is lost or not correctly passed between `initializePlayer` and `createSession`.
5.  **Database Rejection:** The `createSession` function constructs and sends a request to Supabase with a `null` `video_id`, which the database correctly rejects, leading to the `400 Bad Request` and the `code: '23502'` error.

**Conclusion:** The root cause is a logic error within `fluent-flow-supabase-store.ts`. The `video_id`, while available in the `sidepanel.tsx` component, is not being correctly propagated through the `initializePlayer` and/or `createSession` functions, resulting in a `null` value being sent to the database.

## 4. Suggested Next Steps

To fix this bug, a developer should investigate `fluent-flow-supabase-store.ts` and:

1.  Examine the `initializePlayer` function to ensure it correctly receives the `video_id` and passes it to `createSession`.
2.  Examine the `createSession` function to ensure it correctly includes the received `video_id` in the object payload for the Supabase `insert()` operation.
