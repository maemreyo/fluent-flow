Investigated why videoUrl is undefined in QuestionReviewList.tsx.

1. Traced data flow from QuestionReviewList.tsx backwards.
2. Identified that `results` prop comes from `useGroupQuizWithProgress` hook, which wraps `useGroupQuiz` hook.
3. Found that `useGroupQuiz`'s `calculateFinalResults` function constructs the `results` object.
4. The `videoUrl` was missing from the question result objects created in `calculateFinalResults`.
5. The `videoUrl` is available in the `QuestionSet` but was not being stored.

Fix implemented:

1. In `useGroupQuiz.ts`, added a state variable `videoUrl`.
2. In `useGroupQuiz.ts`, modified `handlePresetSelect` to extract and store `videoUrl` from the loaded `questionSet`.
3. In `useGroupQuiz.ts`, updated `calculateFinalResults` to include the stored `videoUrl` in each question's result object.
4. Added logging in `useGroupQuiz.ts` and `QuestionReviewList.tsx` to monitor the data flow for verification.
