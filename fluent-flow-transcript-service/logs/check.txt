  transcript: `Welcome back everyone. Vlad here. I'm celebrating 15 years of a great marriage with my beautiful wife Lana, and I want to share with you actually, things I wished I would have known before getting married. With it also will be some of, I believe, secrets to a thriving marriage, and you'll wish you knew this sooner. Maybe you're watching and you're single. The best time to get ready for marriage is now. To educate yourself, to be aware of what it takes to have a healthy marriage. Not when you get married but before you get married. Maybe you are married. I believe some of these things will resonate with you, and not only I believe you will see those valuable in your life, but this could actually bring some hope, change, and growth in your own marriage. Now, my story with Lana goes in, is I met her, you know, on Facebook. I always joke and I said, you can use a mouse to find a spouse. So, at the time, I had like a personal Facebook page, and she added me as a friend. And then, you know, I saw her. So I went to preach at this church that I was frequently preaching at, and this is the church that she was going to. So this was a different state—actually, no. It's the same state, but it's about three and a half hours away from where I live. And the youth pastor was a good friend of mine, and then I met her there. So I technically met her like at church, but I met her first on Facebook. And then we started seeing each other, and then sometime later, I proposed, and we were married.. That's a shortened version. In my book "Single Ready to Mingle," I share a little bit of an extended version of that, as well as how to find a spouse, and etc. But today I'm going to deal specifically with things I wish I would have known before getting married. The first thing is: marriage won't fix you, but it will expose you. Getting married does not solve your issues. It actually will highlight them. So if you got anger, if you got lust, if you got impatience, that's the issue I had to deal with. Past traumas, they are not going to get healed by marriage. Actually, they will be magnified by marriage. So, if you're walking into marriage hoping that it's a therapy for your issues, if you're hoping that this is where you're going to find healing. I want to remind you that before you find your healing in marriage, you will actually have those issues be highlighted, where you will have to seek healing. Whether it's through deliverance, whether it's through counseling, through therapy. Whatever means that the Lord's going to use to bring healing to whatever those issues are. In, you know, my case, I had a lot of immaturity, a lot of growth, a lot of, especially, impatience`,

Video Title: What I Wish I Knew Before Getting Married

Transcript (with timestamps):
[0:00-0:07] Welcome back everyone. Vlad here. I'm celebrating 15 years of a great marriage with my beautiful
[0:07-0:13] wife Lana, and I want to share with you actually, things I wished I would have known before getting
[0:13-0:18] married. With it also will be some of, I believe, secrets to a thriving marriage,
[0:18-0:24] and you'll wish you knew this sooner. Maybe you're watching and you're single. The best time to get
[0:24-0:31] ready for marriage is now. To educate yourself, to be aware of what it takes to have a healthy
[0:31-0:35] marriage. Not when you get married but before you get married. Maybe you are married. I believe some
[0:35-0:40] of these things will resonate with you, and not only I believe you will see those valuable in your
[0:40-0:46] life, but this could actually bring some hope, change, and growth in your own marriage. Now,
[0:46-0:52] my story with Lana goes in, is I met her, you know, on Facebook. I always joke and I said,
[0:52-0:58] you can use a mouse to find a spouse. So, at the time, I had like a personal Facebook page, and she
[0:58-1:03] added me as a friend. And then, you know, I saw her. So I went to preach at this church that I was
[1:03-1:08] frequently preaching at, and this is the church that she was going to. So this was a different
[1:08-1:11] state—actually, no. It's the same state, but it's about three and a half hours away from where I
[1:11-1:16] live. And the youth pastor was a good friend of mine, and then I met her there. So I technically
[1:16-1:22] met her like at church, but I met her first on Facebook. And then we started seeing each other,
[1:22-1:27] and then sometime later, I proposed, and we were married.. That's a shortened version. In my book
[1:27-1:32] "Single Ready to Mingle," I share a little bit of an extended version of that, as well as how
[1:32-1:37] to find a spouse, and etc. But today I'm going to deal specifically with things I wish I would have
[1:37-1:47] known before getting married. The first thing is: marriage won't fix you, but it will expose you.
[1:47-1:54] Getting married does not solve your issues. It actually will highlight them. So if you got anger,
[1:54-2:00] if you got lust, if you got impatience, that's the issue I had to deal with. Past traumas,
[2:00-2:06] they are not going to get healed by marriage. Actually, they will be magnified by marriage. So,
[2:06-2:11] if you're walking into marriage hoping that it's a therapy for your issues, if you're hoping that
[2:11-2:17] this is where you're going to find healing. I want to remind you that before you find
[2:17-2:23] your healing in marriage, you will actually have those issues be highlighted, where you will have
[2:23-2:28] to seek healing. Whether it's through deliverance, whether it's through counseling, through therapy.
[2:28-2:34] Whatever means that the Lord's going to use to bring healing to whatever those issues are. In,
[2:34-2:40] you know, my case, I had a lot of immaturity, a lot of growth, a lot of, especially, impatience
