# Privacy Policy for Fluent Flow

**Effective Date:** Mon 25 Aug 2025

Thank you for using Fluent Flow ("the extension"). This policy explains how we
collect, use, and protect your information.

## 1. Data We Collect

To provide and sync your data, we need to process the following:

- **User Account Information:** To save your data across devices, we require
  user authentication. We collect your email address and a unique user
  identifier provided by our backend service, Supabase.

- **User-Generated Data:** We store the Loops and Practice Questions that you
  create. This data is associated with your user account to enable syncing.

- **Anonymous Usage Data:** We may collect anonymous data about your
  interactions with the extension's features (e.g., which buttons are clicked)
  to understand how our product is used and to improve the user experience.

- **Technical Data:** The extension needs to identify the URL of the YouTube
  page you are on to activate and function correctly. We do not track your
  browsing history on sites other than YouTube.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

- **To Provide Core Features:** To save, retrieve, and sync your loops and
  questions across different devices.
- **To Authenticate Your Account:** To securely log you in and ensure you can
  only access your own data.
- **To Improve Our Product:** To analyze feature usage to optimize the interface
  and overall user experience.

## 3. Third-Party Data Sharing

We use Supabase as our primary backend service provider for database storage and
user authentication. When you create an account, create loops, or ask questions,
your data is securely transmitted to and stored on Supabase's servers. We do not
sell or share your personal data with any other third parties.

Additionally, to provide AI-powered features, we may send contextual information
from the video you are watching to Google's Generative AI API. This request does
not include any of your personally identifiable information.

## 4. Data Storage and Security

Your data, including your account information, loops, and questions, is stored
securely in our database, which is hosted by Supabase. We implement security
measures, including Supabase's built-in features like Row Level Security, to
ensure that your data is protected and that you can only access your own
information.

## 5. Your Rights

You have full control over your data. You can view, modify, and delete all of
your loops and questions at any time through the extension's interface. You can
also request the deletion of your entire account by contacting us.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy in the future. Any changes will be posted on this
page.
